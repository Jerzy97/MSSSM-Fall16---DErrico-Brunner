TO-DO:
Finish second plotting function

Added Cops grievance and set it to -1 -> easier to distinct between cops and empty cells when plotting

Starting simulations: what shall we actually record? Which parameters to observe?

Need to decide what to record: Interesting probably grievance vs. state

In generate_actor: Is the less sign correct (line 40)

Need to set function for cop arresting ability (Dependent on expenditure on public order and safety)

Updating Processes:

 -> Empty Cells: Birth & getting filled citizens released from jail
 -> Citizen: Update personal parameters (Felt hardship & stuff), move, die
 -> Rebell: Move (what are they actually doing?) maybe not paying taxes, die
 -> Jail: Decrement Jail Time & if zero fill empty spots, die
 -> Cops: Arrest, move, die

Cop:
1. 2 (Role)
2. V (Age)
3. P (Arrest probability)
4. 0
.
.
.
9. 0

Citizen:
1. 1 (Role)
2. V (Age)
3. H (Hardship)
4. L (Legitimacy)
5. G (Grievance)
6. R (Risk aversion)
7. N (Net Risk) 



Instead of setting random parameters of: Cop Distribution, Percentage of map occupied, etc. we could use real world Data!
Inspiration by: Empirical Performance of a Decentralized Civil Violence Model - Klemens, Epstein , Hammond, Raifman
Possible Datasets: PITF

From empirical studies (paper above) we learn that the so called "Repressive Capacity" is quite an important factor. It has been approximated by the military expenses as a percentage of GNI (BIP), but also Jail time will probably influence this one.
We need to be particularly cautious setting Jail Time therefore!

Count people for taxes: Need to clear who pays taxes -> do active rebellion members pay taxes?
