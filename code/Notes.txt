TO-DO:

Multiple actors are updated during one iteration! WHY? :'(

Hardship does not change

Introduce Alessinas utility function and use it for Legitimacy -> this of course is not the whole story, but acounts for the parameters we want to observe (income and taxes)

Observe behaviour for sudden changes of legitimacy -> test states stability

When running the model for different values of CI/CP etc. we should set some benchmark to record "outbursts" (Epstein choose 50)

Proposal for the Cop arresting efficiency function:
P(CI)=Pmax-Const1*Exp(-Const2*Ci)
P(Cop2ActiveRatio)=1 - 1/(1 + Exp(-10 CA)) (Sigmoid function)
This comes from the idea that at some threshold if the cop to active ratio is too high, cops will not execute their job anymore!
Could be negative, but for the simplicity of our program we did not account for that

Starting simulations: what shall we actually record? Which parameters to observe?
Need to decide what to record: Interesting probably grievance vs. state

Updating Processes:

 -> Empty Cells: Birth & getting filled citizens released from jail
 -> Citizen: Update personal parameters (Felt hardship & stuff), move, die
 -> Rebell: Move (what are they actually doing?) maybe not paying taxes, die
 -> Jail: Decrement Jail Time & if zero fill empty spots, die
 -> Cops: Arrest, move, die

Instead of setting random parameters of: Cop Distribution, Percentage of map occupied, etc. we could use real world Data!
Inspiration by: Empirical Performance of a Decentralized Civil Violence Model - Klemens, Epstein , Hammond, Raifman
Possible Datasets: PITF

Count people for taxes: Need to clear who pays taxes -> do active rebellion members pay taxes?
