## General Introduction

Drawing back on old experiences and knowledge is one important point in the process of opinion formation and decision making. In this paper we want to investigate the effects of older decisions, regarding similar situations, on those we are about to make in the future. Formulated in another way: How independent are our decisions?

This comprehensive question can, of course, not be answered within a single paper. Instead we want to contribute to the understanding of this topic by simulating a case, where those effects can be observed relatively easy. In particular one essential part of our work will be to implement an algorithm that is able to do data fitting using both, the 'fixed' knowledge given by us from the very beginning, as well as the experience gained from older fitting processes.
The next step is the learning process, during which we are going to confront the program with datasets of mainly one distribution, so that it gains great experience on this one, but stays unfamiliar with other distribution kinds.
Afterwards it is possible to check, whether our algorithm will still be able to distinguish one clearly defined distribution from the one it has great experience of.

## The Model

Our model will be based on concepts, which are usually found in machine learning algorithms. Since we are interested in human decision making, the most appropriate type of 'learner' would probably be a neural network, which is often and with reason refered to as the bionically inspired approach of artificial intelligence.

### Note

Since the groups background in machine learning is not huge, this will take a considerable amount of our project-time.
If there's time left, different approaches can be chosen and results compared.

## Fundamental Questions

As mentioned above, our main questions can be summarized as follows:
* How are we influenced by our older decisions?
* Is it, after a long time of devoting oneself to a specific topic, still possible to be open minded for different solutions or will there be a significant tendency to applying the same scheme again and again?
* Can we trick our model after a long time feeding the same distribution?

## Expected Results

Since a neural network is well known for having a certain degree of inaccuracy tolerance, we actually believe we can trick our program.

## Research Methods

Implementing a neural network, we certainly use some kind of an agent-based model.
